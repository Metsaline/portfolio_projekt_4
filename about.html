            Jay Mead (July 18, 1933 â€“ December 30, 2019) was an American industrial designer and neo-futurist
            concept artist, widely known for his designs for science-fiction films such as Blade Runner, Aliens and
            Tron. Mead has been described as "the artist who illustrates the future" and "one of the most
            influential concept artists and industrial designers of our time.
            Early life - Mead was born on July 18, 1933, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was a Baptist minister,
            who read him pulp magazines, such as Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon, sparking his interest in science fiction.
            Mead was skilled in drawing at a young age. According to Mead, "by the time I was in high school I could
            draw the human figure, I could draw animals, and I had a sense of shading to show shape. I was really quite
            accomplished at that point with brush technique and so-forth."
